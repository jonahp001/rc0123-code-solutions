            <h2>It's the foundation for patient-centered primary care.</h2>
            <p>Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care across clinicians, staff,
              and patients themselves &mdash; making you more productive, less, stressed, and
              adding just a bit more joy into your practice of medicine.

              the last blood count. Canvas pulls everything you need directly into your note, so you never have to
              leave it. And because Canvas learns from every interaction, it gets smarter with every patient you see.

                a lot to ask and those are tremendously important questions. But I just couldn't get an answer from our old

            <h2>It automates performance improvement</h2>
            <p>Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you understand performance, but they aren't enough
              to improve quality and increase revenue day after day. Canvas automates quality protocols and charge
              capture so clinicians can focus on more complex work only they can do.

              how we were going to keep up. We're a small practice and we don't have a big quality team or a group of
              coders to catch everything. The automation in Canvas has completely eliminated any concerns around quality
